# Scraper utility functions for d3

I use d3 extensively as a scraper: open the devtools, write the
appropriate d3 expression, get some nice JSON out.

This script contains a number of utility methods that make this more
convenient.

Combine it with a bookmarklet, and you can have a nice web scraper
under your fingertips with not a lot of effort.

Note that a number of methods have relatively unreadable names because
I don't want to type veryLongDescriptiveMethod; I want "doIt()" instead.
